instructions

Just unzip the file and place the content into a folder
everything is in the main root, thanks.

comments to the files:

I used many few div, cause I thought to better give a structure to the website for 2 reasons:
[1] want to follow object oriented coding
[2] if somebody [not for this but for some other work in the future] wants to get the hands on it, it might be more fluent and easy to read in this way

style1.css is the external css file for style

I tried to make it more user friendly as possible by using clean design, and format and there is not much on the html that needs to be commented
I tried to use html5 as base

thanks
andrea
